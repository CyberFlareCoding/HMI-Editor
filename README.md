# HMI-Editor
This is a program that takes the file exported from your machine (usually in the form of a txt file) and converts/translates it to an MS Excel document so you can edit it. After doing so, you have the option to also convert it back along with some other options.

Additionally, this was strictly made with client side JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in order to allow the source code to be downloaded and used offline. Also, libraries for JavaScript are not used to keep the file sizes and HTML load time as small as possible. 

This is hosted using github pages at cyberflarecoding.github.io/HMI-Editor
